# Miele W1 & T1 Complete Laundry Program & Fabric Care Guide

**Critical finding**: Several programs specified (Cottons Pro, Whites, Colored Items, Towels) are **not standard UK domestic W1/T1 programs** - they appear in Miele Professional (commercial) machines or US market models. This guide provides UK equivalents where exact matches don't exist, clearly marked throughout.

---

## Part 1: Miele W1 washing machine programs

### Program availability note

UK domestic W1 washing machines use different program naming than commercial or US models. Programs like "Cottons Pro," "Whites (90)/(75)," and "Colored Items (60)/(20)" are not standard selections—users instead select **Cottons** and adjust temperature manually. The "Towels" program exists on US models but not UK domestic versions.

### Complete specifications for all 12 programs

| Specification | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| Intended use | "Cotton garments that have hardly been worn or are only very lightly soiled" |
| NOT suitable for | **Anything beyond lightly soiled**—stained, moderately soiled, or delicate items |
| Key limitation | Short extra option activated automatically; cannot handle significant soiling |
| Alternative | For moderately soiled quick washes, use **QuickPowerWash** (4.0 kg, ~49–59 min) |

### Key questions answered

**What makes "Cottons Pro" different from regular Cottons?**
Cottons Pro is a **Miele Professional (commercial) program** unavailable on domestic W1 machines. It features enhanced hygiene capabilities, extended wash times, and commercial-grade cleaning designed for hotels and care homes.

**Is "Towels" a hygiene cycle?**
The US "Towels" program uses **60°C default with intensive agitation** but is not a dedicated hygiene cycle. For UK users wanting hygiene performance, use **Cottons at 60°C** or **Cottons Hygiene** (60–90°C with extended temperature holding times that remove 99.99% of bacteria).

**Is Delicates (30) suitable for silk?**
**No.** Silk requires the dedicated **Silks** program: ultra-sensitive handwash rhythm, maximum **1.0 kg** load, cold to 30°C, **600 rpm** max spin.

## Part 2: Miele T1 tumble dryer programs

### Naming clarification

Miele uses **program name + drying level** format. The requested names combine these in non-standard ways:

| Task Naming | Official Miele Format |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Cottons+ (Closet) | Cottons → Extra dry level |
| Cottons (Closet) | Cottons → Normal level |
| Cottons (Iron) | Cottons → Hand iron level |
| Cottons (Spin) | Cottons → Machine iron level |
| Delicates (Closet) | Delicates → Normal level |
| Smoothing (Iron) | Pre-ironing program |

### Complete specifications for all 12 dryer programs

| Program | Drying Level | Heat Setting | Duration | Max Load | Drum Action | Cool-down |
|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cottons+ (Closet)** | Extra dry (bone dry) | Standard heat-pump | Sensor: ~160–188 min | 8.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes + 2hr anti-crease |
| **Cottons (Closet)** | Normal (~1% moisture) | Standard heat-pump | Sensor: ~136–177 min | 8.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes + anti-crease |
| **Delicates (Closet)** | Normal (cupboard dry) | **Low temperature** | Sensor: ~65 min | 2.5 kg | Gentle continuous | Yes (extended) |
| **Cottons (Iron)** | Hand iron (~5–10% moisture) | Standard heat-pump | Sensor: ~107–154 min | 8.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes |
| **Cottons (Spin)** | Machine iron (~15–20% moisture) | Standard heat-pump | Sensor (shorter) | 8.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes |
| **Minimum Iron (Closet)** | Normal (cupboard dry) | Medium temperature | Sensor: ~65–74 min | 4.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes |
| **Minimum Iron (Iron)** | Hand iron (damp) | Medium temperature | Sensor (shorter) | 4.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes |
| **Smoothing (Iron)** | Normal or Hand iron | **Low** (Gentle tumble ON) | ~50 min | 1.0 kg | Gentle tumble | Yes |
| **Woolens** | Preset (fluff only) | **Very low/extra gentle** | **~5 minutes only** | 2.0 kg | Very gentle intermittent | No—remove immediately |
| **Timed Drying Warm Air (40)** | User-controlled | Warm (~55–65°C) | **20 min to 3 hours** | 8.0 kg | Continuous | Manual control |
| **Shirts** | Normal or Hand iron | Medium-low | Sensor: ~60–71 min | 2.0 kg | Gentle continuous | Yes |
| **Express** | All levels available | Standard heat-pump | ~100–125 min | 4.0 kg | Continuous reverse | Yes |

### Detailed program specifications

**1. COTTONS - EXTRA DRY vs NORMAL (Cottons+ vs Cottons Closet)**

The key difference is residual moisture level:

| Feature | Extra Dry (Cottons+) | Normal (Cottons) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Target moisture | Bone dry (0%) | ~1% residual |
| Best for | Multi-layered thick fabrics, towelling, bathrobes | Everyday cotton: T-shirts, underwear, baby clothes |
| **NOT for** | Jersey fabrics—tendency to shrink | Items needing extra dryness |
| Energy use | ~1.41 kWh (8 kg) | ~1.25 kWh (8 kg) |

**2. SMOOTHING/PRE-IRONING**

**Is it a steam cycle?** On basic T1 models (TWF, TDB, TCE), it uses **warm air and gentle tumbling only—no steam**. It relaxes fibres to reduce spin-cycle creases. Premium T1 models with SoftSteam (TWi180WP, TWV series) have actual steam injection.

| Specification | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| Purpose | Smooth out creasing from washing spin cycle |
| Can use on dry fabrics | Yes—removes wrinkles from stored items |
| Critical instruction | **Remove garments immediately** after program ends |

**3. COTTONS (SPIN/MACHINE IRON)**

**Is this spin-only with no heat?** **No**—there is no spin-only program on Miele T1 dryers. Machine iron is the dampest drying level but **still uses heat**. It simply stops earlier, leaving items ready for steam pressing (~15–20% moisture).

**4. WOOLENS HANDCARE**

**Can it fully dry wool?** **No—it is a fluff/refresh cycle only**, lasting approximately **5 minutes**. Items must be removed immediately and finished air-drying at room temperature.

| Specification | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| Energy consumption | Only ~0.02 kWh |
| Miele instruction | "Items are only fluffed up, NOT dried completely; remove garments immediately and finish drying at room temperature" |

**5. TIMED DRYING WARM AIR**

**Is "40" the time or temperature?** **40 = minutes** (time), not temperature. Users select duration from 20 minutes to 3 hours in 10-minute increments. Temperature is standard heat-pump warm air (~55–65°C).

| Use cases | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Multi-layered items | Jackets, pillows, sleeping bags with varying drying characteristics |
| Individual items | Finishing partially dried items |
| Odour removal | Use with dampened items for at least 60 minutes |

**6. DELICATES (CLOSET)**

**Safe for silk or rayon?**
- **Rayon: YES**—explicitly listed in Miele documentation as suitable
- **Silk: NO**—use dedicated Silks handcare program (on models that have it) or Woollens handcare

| Specification | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| Intended use | Synthetic fibre, mixed fibre, rayon, easy-care cotton: shirts, blouses, lingerie, appliquéd garments |
| Key feature | Gentle tumble permanently ON; low temperature |
| Tip | Reducing load further minimizes creasing |

## Part 7: Detergent and additives guide

### Detergent by wash program

| Program | Detergent Type | Amount | Additives OK | Additives to AVOID |
|---------|---------------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Cottons/Cottons Pro** | Universal (bio/non-bio) or UltraPhase 1&2 | Full dose | Fabric softener, oxygen bleach, stain removers | Chlorine bleach on colors |
| **Delicates (30)** | Delicate/mild or liquid color | Reduced (½–⅔) | Fabric softener in moderation | Bio detergents (enzymes), bleach |
| **Minimum Iron (40)** | Color or universal liquid | Reduced (⅔) | Fabric softener | Heavy-duty powder, bleach |
| **Dark Garments** | Color detergent (enzyme-free) or UltraDark | Full dose | None recommended | Optical brighteners, bleach, fabric softener |
| **Denim** | Color liquid | Reduced (½–⅔) | None | Bleach, fabric softener, optical brighteners |
| **Shirts** | Universal or color liquid | Standard | Fabric softener, stain booster for collars | Bio on silk blends |
| **Towels** | Universal/bio (recommended) | Full dose | Oxygen bleach | **Fabric softener** (reduces absorbency) |
| **Express** | Color liquid | Reduced | None needed | Heavy powder (won't dissolve fully) |
| **Whites (90/75)** | Universal powder with bleach or UltraWhite | Full dose + booster | Chlorine/oxygen bleach | Color detergent |
| **Colored Items (60)** | Color detergent or UltraColor | Full dose | Fabric softener | Optical brighteners, chlorine bleach |
| **Colored Items (20)** | Liquid color | Reduced | None needed | Bio powder (won't activate at low temp) |

### Miele TwinDos system

**How UltraPhase 1 & 2 work together:**

| Component | Function | Timing | Key Ingredients |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **UltraPhase 1** | Main detergent—dirt, grease, everyday stains | Start of wash | Surfactants, 7 enzyme types, dye transfer inhibitors |
| **UltraPhase 2** | Cleaning booster—stubborn/pigmented stains | ~30 minutes later | Oxygen bleach (hydrogen peroxide), optical brighteners for whites |

**Dosing ratios:**
- White laundry: 50% UP1 + 50% UP2 (equal parts)
- Colored laundry: 67% UP1 + 33% UP2 (2:1 ratio)

### CapDosing pods

| Symbol | Type | Products | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| ♦ | Detergent | WoolCare, SilkCare, Sport, Outdoor, Down | Specialist fabric programs |
| ▲ | Additives | Booster (oxygen bleach) | Stain boost on any program |
| ● | Fabric Care | Softener, Proofing/ImpraProtect, Fragrance | Final rinse |

### Wool/silk detergent requirements

Must be **pH neutral (pH 7)**, enzyme-free, no bleach, no optical brighteners. Protease enzymes break down protein fibers. Miele WoolCare contains wheat protein; SilkCare contains silk protein.

### Household additives

| Additive | Uses | Amount | When to Add | Avoid On |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **White vinegar** | Softener alternative, odor removal, color setting, detergent residue removal | ½–1 cup | Fabric softener compartment or rinse | Wool/silk (safe but not optimal) |
| **Baking soda** | Detergent booster, stain pre-treatment, odor removal, brighten whites | ½ cup | Drum at start or pre-soak | **Wool, cashmere, silk** (high pH damages protein) |

**Warning:** Never mix vinegar with bleach (creates toxic gas). Do not use vinegar and baking soda in same load (they neutralize each other).

---

## Part 8: Stain pre-treatment guide

| Stain | Pre-Treatment | DON'T Do This | Best Program | Temperature |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Sweat/yellow underarm** | Baking soda + hydrogen peroxide paste; OR white vinegar soak 30 min | Chlorine bleach (makes yellowing WORSE); heat before treating | Cottons with UltraPhase | Warm 40°C—NOT hot until treated |
| **Grease/oil** | Sprinkle cornstarch/talc to absorb 30 min; apply dish soap | Rub while wet; cold water first | Cottons 60°C | Hot 60°C (heat breaks down grease) |
| **Red wine** | Immediately blot + salt; cold water soak; oxygen bleach pre-soak | White wine (myth!); hot water; rub | Cottons 40°C | Cold soak first, then warm |
| **Coffee/tea** | Cold water rinse; white vinegar soak; dish soap + vinegar solution | Hot water first (sets tannins) | Cottons 40°C | Warm 40°C |
| **Blood** | **COLD water ONLY**; salt water soak; enzyme pre-treatment | **ANY hot water** (proteins set permanently) | Cottons 30–40°C bio | **COLD only** until removed |
| **Grass** | White vinegar rub; enzyme pre-treatment; bio soak | Hot water; chlorine bleach on colors | Cottons 40°C bio | Warm 40°C |
| **Ink (ballpoint)** | Rubbing alcohol—dab on back of stain onto paper towels | Rub (spreads ink); water first | Cottons 40°C | Cold/warm 30–40°C |
| **Makeup/foundation** | Micellar water or dish soap for oil-based; shaving cream | Hot water on oil-based makeup | Delicates/Cottons 40°C | Warm 40°C |
| **Deodorant marks** | Fresh: rub with nylon stocking; Set-in: vinegar soak 1 hr | Ignore (leads to yellowing) | Cottons 40°C | Warm 40°C |
| **Mud** | **Let dry completely first**; brush off; enzyme pre-soak | Wash while wet (spreads into fibers) | Cottons 40°C bio | Warm 40°C |

**Universal stain rules:** Act quickly. Always blot, never rub. Test treatments on hidden area. Work outside-in. Check before drying—heat sets most stains permanently.

## Part 9: Spin speed guide

| Fabric/Item | Max Safe RPM | Recommended RPM | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Silk** | 600 | 400–600 (or no spin) | Miele Silks defaults to 600 rpm. Delicate fibers prone to snagging; light weight causes balance issues. |
| **Wool** | 1200 | 600–800 | Higher speeds cause felting and shrinkage through mechanical action. |
| **Delicates/lingerie** | 800 | 400–600 | Underwire, hooks, elastic damaged by high-speed agitation. Use mesh bag. |
| **Dress shirts** | 800 | 600–800 | Lower speeds = fewer wrinkles, easier ironing. Miele Shirts defaults to 800 rpm. |
| **Synthetics** | 1200 | 800–1000 | Heat and high spin cause permanent creasing. |
| **Denim** | 1000 | 600–800 | Prevents white crease lines; turn inside out. Miele Denim defaults to 800 rpm. |
| **Cotton (regular)** | 1600 | 1200–1400 | Cotton tolerates high speeds; removes more water for faster drying. |
| **Towels** | 1600 | 1400–1600 | Terry cloth durable; high extraction reduces drying time, preserves fluffiness. |
| **Bedding** | 1200 | 800–1000 | Large items unbalance at high speeds; 1000 rpm protects seams. |

**Miele options:** Rinse Hold (suspends laundry in water to reduce creasing); No Spin (available on most programs for very delicate items).

## Part 10: Temperature science

| Temperature | What It Does | When Necessary | Trade-offs |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cold/20°C** | Basic refresh; relies on detergent surfactants; preserves colors and elasticity | Lightly worn items, color preservation, energy saving (up to 76% vs hot) | Not effective for sanitization; may not remove heavy staining; detergent residue builds up |
| **30°C** | Light cleaning; gentle on fibers; preserves colors | Silk, wool, delicates, cashmere, dark garments, spandex, rayon | Insufficient for killing bacteria; may not remove body oils fully |
| **40°C** | Most common everyday temperature; effective stain removal | Regular clothing, mixed loads, lightly to moderately soiled items | Not sanitizing without bleach; some color fading over time |
| **60°C** | **SANITIZATION THRESHOLD**: kills most bacteria, viruses, dust mites; removes body oils and stubborn stains | Underwear, towels, bedding, baby clothes, post-illness items. **NHS recommends 60°C** for germ prevention | Higher energy; can shrink some fabrics; may fade colors |
| **75°C** | Extended hygiene; effective allergen deactivation | Post-illness items, heavily soiled, allergy sufferers | High energy; 2+ hour cycles; shrinkage risk for non-cotton |
| **90°C** | Maximum stain removal and sanitization; machine maintenance | White cotton/linen only; heavily soiled; monthly machine clean | Very high energy; significant shrinkage; fades colors; cotton/linen only |

**Critical note:** 60°C washing reduces bacteria by 3–5 log₁₀ CFU; tumble drying adds another 3–4 log₁₀ reduction. NHS advises: 60°C **OR** 40°C with bleach-based product for equivalent germ elimination.

## Part 11: Load size guidance

### Washing machine (W1)

| Program | Max Load | Practical Max | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Cottons** | 8.0 kg | 5–6 kg | Fill drum 2/3 for best cleaning |
| **Delicates** | 2.0–3.0 kg | 1.5–2.0 kg | Extra drum space for gentle tumbling |
| **Minimum Iron** | 3.5–4.0 kg | 2.5–3.0 kg | Reduced load prevents creasing |
| **Dark Garments** | 3.0 kg | 2.0 kg | Lower load allows extra rinses (3–5) |
| **Denim** | 3.0 kg (max 2 pairs) | 2.0 kg | High water level needed |
| **Shirts** | 1.0–2.0 kg | 1.0–1.5 kg | Small load prevents collar abrasion |
| **Towels** | 5.0–8.0 kg | 4.0–5.0 kg | Need thorough water penetration |
| **Express** | 3.5 kg | 2.0–2.5 kg | Short cycle can't handle large loads |
| **Whites/Colored (Cottons)** | 8.0 kg | 5–6 kg | Same as Cottons |
| **Woolens** | 2.0 kg | 1.5 kg | Very small load |
| **Silks** | 1.0 kg | 0.5–0.75 kg | Extremely small load |
| **Outdoor/Gore-Tex** | 2.5 kg | 2.0 kg | Specialist program |

### Tumble dryer (T1)

| Program | Max Load | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Cottons (all levels)** | 8.0 kg | Reduce for Extra dry to prevent shrinkage |
| **Delicates** | 2.5 kg | Reduce further to minimize creasing |
| **Minimum Iron** | 4.0 kg | — |
| **Smoothing/Pre-ironing** | 1.0 kg | Very small—remove immediately |
| **Woolens** | 2.0 kg | Fluff only, not full drying |
| **Shirts** | 2.0 kg | Reduce to minimize creasing |
| **Express** | 4.0 kg | Reduced from full Cottons capacity |
| **Timed Warm Air** | 8.0 kg | — |

**Key principle:** Practical loads should be **20–30% below stated maximum** for optimal results. Miele's automatic load control adjusts water and energy but cannot compensate for overloading.
